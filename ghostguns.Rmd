## Ghost Guns

[Evolving Trend - Unserialized and Untraceable FireArms]{style="color: red;"}

![Science \| HowStuffWorks](ghost_guns.jpg)

| What are ghost guns?
| *Ghost guns are unserialized and untraceable firearms that are constructed by individuals using unfinished frames or receivers. They are available for purchase by anyone, including prohibited purchasers, domestic abusers, and gun traffickers -- without a background check.*

<br></br>  Federal Regulations

<p>

*The gun laws do not require a background check to purchase a ghost gun kit or parts because the receivers and frames are unfinished. An individual can legally purchase a receiver or frame that is 80-percent complete or less, then modify the parts with a drill press or power drill, a router jig, and other components into an effective and reliable firearm.*

### Sentiment on Ghost Guns

[Webscrape Newspaper Articles with `xml2 and rvest package`]{style="color: blue;"} <br></br> URL links the selected newspaper articles was loaded, each individual text body was selected with [SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/) in Chrome. The `SelectorGadget` extracted the HTML nodes form these newspapers article text-body:

```{r federalist-body}

federalist.root.html <- read_html("https://thefederalist.com/2018/08/02/3-d-printed-guns-reminder-gun-control-america-futile/")
federalist.body <- federalist.root.html %>%
  html_nodes("p") %>%  # indicates node name
  html_text(trim = TRUE) 

names(federalist.body) <- c("newspaper") # insert new column for newspaper name

federalist.body <- as_tibble(federalist.body)

federalist.body$newspaper <- "Federalist"
```

```{r guardian-body, echo=FALSE}
guardian.root.html <- read_html("https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/18/california-ghost-guns-deadly-toll")
guardian.body <- guardian.root.html %>%
  html_nodes("h2 , .dcr-o5gy41") %>%  # indicates nodes name

  html_nodes(".heavy-text , .crd--cnt p") %>% # indicates nodes name
html_text(trim = TRUE) 

names(tribune.body) <- c("newspaper")

tribune.body <- as_tibble(tribune.body)

tribune.body$newspaper <- "Tribune"
```

### Create Corpus

A corpus format will store the newspapers textual data, `.body`, for text analysis.

```{r}

corpus <- rbind(federalist.body, guardian.body, tribune.body)
corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(corpus))

#inspect(corpus)
```

#### Transform: Cleaning the Corpus

Using the `tm package` the corpus is formatted before any analysis by performing these transformations: tolower, removePunctation, removeNumbers, and remove stopwords.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
corpus_text <- tm_map(corpus[1], tolower)

#inspect(corpus_text)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
corpus_text <- tm_map(corpus_text, removePunctuation)
corpus_text <- tm_map(corpus_text, removeNumbers)

#inspect(corpus_text [1:3])
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cleanset <- tm_map(corpus_text, removeWords, stopwords('english'))

#inspect(cleanset[1:3])
```

#### Create a term-document matrix

The term-document matrix will compare all the terms or words across each document. The tdm results was sorted and summarized in a decreasing order. The selected `Ghost Guns articles`top 5 frequent words pertain to *gun, guns, ghost, said, and violence*.

```{r text-mining, echo=FALSE}

tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(cleanset)
tdm <- as.matrix(tdm)

words <- sort(rowSums(tdm), decreasing = TRUE)

df <- data.frame(word = names(words), freq = words)

head(df, 5)
```

### Word Cloud

Visualization of words

```{r echo=FALSE}

w <- sort(rowSums(tdm), decreasing = TRUE)
set.seed(222)
wordcloud(words = names(w),
          freq = w,
          max.words = 500,
          random.order = F,
          min.freq = 3,
          colors = brewer.pal(8, 'Dark2'),
          scale = c(6, 0.4),
          rot.per = 0.7)
```

The above word cloud clearly shows that "gun", "guns", "ghost", "violence", and "said" are the five most important words in the Corpus.

### Sentiment Analysis

The `syuzhet package` will pull out the emotions from the selected newspaper articles. The issue of controlling the expanding ghost gun accessibility has a slightly huger negative emotion than positive. The next three emotions, fear, anger, and trust, also indicates the impact of a ghost gun as a firearm.

```{r sentiment-score, echo=FALSE}
s <- get_nrc_sentiment(df$word)
head(s, 5)
```

```{r sentiment-plot, echo=FALSE}
barplot(colSums(s),
        las = 2,
        col = rainbow(10),
        ylab = 'Count',
        main = 'Sentiment Scores Issue')
```
